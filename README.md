# Rust Cryptography

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of cryptographic hashing in Rust. It focuses on generating a SHA-256 hash of a given input string, illustrating fundamental cryptographic principles along with Rust's powerful programming capabilities.

## Features
- Generates a SHA-256 hash for a predefined string.
- Utilizes the `sha2` Rust crate for cryptographic functions.

## Requirements
- Rust programming language
- Cargo package manager
